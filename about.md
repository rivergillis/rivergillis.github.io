I'm River and this is my blog/place to upload personal projects/place to dump my awful stories.
If you stumbled upon this place by chance and think I'm a pretty cool person you can reach me via my [email](mailto:jrivergillis@gmail.com), my [GitHub](https://github.com/rivergillis), or my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rivergillis).

Alternatively, you can check out my resume [here](../resume.pdf).
