        <title>Frank III</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The sun was still hiding as Frank crept out onto the porch. Excitement abound, Frank had found. It was time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baskets in hand, Frank nearly lept to the fields for the harvest. A good hard day of work was ahead of him, something he felt he had needed for quite some time.
As he plucked the first berry from the bush, Frank knew why he had chosen this path. He had created something beautiful and nurtured its growth. Then he laughed and remembered the real reason was because his father had been a farmer, so then he had been destined to take up the farm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Was that what he wanted? Surely it was, how else could he live with himself? It made him feel good, the excitement for the harvest was proof enough. But what if he had had a choice?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sun should be out now, where is it? Frank took a moment to look at the sky for signs of light, none to be found. Dark clouds sheathed the earth, a storm was sure to follow. Frank thought to go inside, but only for a moment. This was everything.
As Frank continued plucking, he noticed something interesting. The path he trod on had boot-shaped indentions in the dirt, as if it had recently been trodden mud. That couldn’t be right. It hasn’t rained for quite some time. Further whose marks were those? It couldn’t have been his. Something wasn’t right here. Frank should go inside, try again tomorrow. The storm was nearly here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then what was he here for? He wasn’t raised to be a quitter. Actually, he wasn’t raised to be anything but a farmer. A blank slate with which to paint a beautiful life. Here Frank was, feeling as if had forgotten the paints and brushes. Cynical as he was, Frank really did find the world beautiful. A fantastic abomination, a freak incident that shouldn’t exist, something to love because we should, something to destroy because we can, something to marvel at because it is. Frank could use this feeling to create something beautiful, a piece of art to be respected for centuries to come, something to show the world that he had existed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frank tossed these thoughts aside, or at least tried to. I’m sure this wasn’t the first time Frank thought these things. He was a farmer. That was Frank. He could do no more, as this is what he had been chosen for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frank noticed raindrops hitting his boots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exploration, that was it. The spark he needed to create something beautiful. He had never been out of Georgia in his life, and he needed to see the world. He needed adventure, there was so much unknown left in this world and he surely could be the one to figure it out, whatever it was that needed to be figured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something was amiss in Frank’s blueberry field, he noticed a long straight clearing in front of him, the earth seemed to be scorched and the boot tracks from earlier led to this path. The path itself was littered with boot tracks, it seemed as if every single inch of this area had been trodden thousands of times over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frank followed the path, this was it. This was what he needed, he dropped his basket in pursuit of knowledge, of artistic inspiration, of self-meaning. The path was long and remained completely straight. After nearly twenty minutes of travel, Frank arrived at a crossroads. The path split into 3 in front of him, the paths to the left and right ejected at 45 degree angles and the center path continued onward. Looking at the boot tracks, it was clear the ejected paths were dead-ends, they were the only paths in which he saw tracks returning to the center. Onwards was the answer, it seemed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rain was now pouring down, the wind buffeted Frank. He needs to go back inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something was moving up ahead. Was that the wind throwing the bushes? The tracks began to disperse, only a few sets of shoes continued onwards. The ground began to take on a new consistency, something slimy coated it. The air was dense. This was not fog. A foreign substance entered Franks lung’s and spread through his body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His excitement this morning was real, he had determined. That meant something to Frank, it made him feel something. When was the last time he felt something? His whole life had been a waste, he had no reason to live. This was the one thing he needed. This would make Frank happy. Figure it out. What’s causing this? It must be the being up ahead. He was close now, he could make out this being more clearly now. Its human shape was a ruse, this was not human. Tentacles protruded from under its pantlegs. Tentacles bundled together to support its body and writhing furiously. Tentacles that belonged to no animal that had ever existed. It had stopped moving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The storm had become a hurricane, water peirced the Earth with great fury. A torrent of emotion came over frank. He must not go back inside. He walked up to the monstrosity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Face to face. Was that a face?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The skin was blue, the pores of its face were moving around. Those were not pores, the microscopic tentacles forming the being’s being moved with chaos, it was as if this thing were flickering in and out of existence. There was no nose, the middle of its face was an array of tentacles protruding from deep inside of it. Frank followed the facial features up into its eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The farm exploded. The unreal unfolded in front of Frank, there was no farm. Frank did not exist, this being was the only thing that was real. Visions of another world became Frank, untold secrets. Ancient secrets. A thousand lifetimes passed before Frank’s eyes, he had become everyone and everything that had ever existed and ever will exist. He shouldn’t know this. This was not beautiful, this was vile. He stood there, mouth agape in horror. His mind had unfolded and was pouring out of him. The creature opened its mouth and with crack of a whip tentacles flew from its mouth deep into Frank’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frank’s internal organs instantly ruptured. The tentacles expanded to fill the entirety of Frank’s body and then some. His blood exploded and his bones became dust. An instant later the tentacles retracted, leaving something new, something foreign inside of Frank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frank fell to the ground, destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Frank II</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the middle, there was Frank. Frank was a kindhearted man who believed that no matter what situation you are born in; you can achive greatness. That’s what he told me, anyway, and I’ve no reason to believe that old fool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 1945 Frank sat on his Georgian porch and drank sweet tea. &lt;em&gt;His&lt;/em&gt; sweet tea, though he’d be ready to share it in an instant. A whole pitcher of it, actually. Frank knew his doctor had told him to ease up on the sugar intake, but these days the only thing that made Frank happy was the sweet tea. It’s like the sucrose found had found a way to temporarily fill the cracks in his heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When there was news of famine or draught or death, as had been typical recently, Frank did not notice. When there was news of heartbreak or loneliness, Frank was often the source and would seclude back to his porch to drink his sweet tea. A pitcher twice daily was the norm. It was always there for him, ready to brighten his mood or rather to bear his weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frank rarely thought of himself, but he realized it would nearly be time to harvest the blueberries. Frank was excited.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Tractor</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Tractor woke with a bang, for he had an idea. The only problem was that he had already forgotten it, but he knew that it had existed, if only during his dreams. He had trouble remembering his dreams lately, apparently they happen whether you remember them or not. The fact that it had existed, that a good idea had recently existed in his head, gave Tractor the motivation needed to get up an start his day off right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forty-five minutes later, Tractor was spick, span, and ready to go. He was as clean as the gentrified streets and fresher than his rhymes. “Off to work!” he thought, as he sat down before the whiteboard in his apartment. Hours passed, and not a single mark had been made. How could Tractor have written anything? He hadn’t had brunch yet. That was his line of thinking, anyway, as he shut the door behind him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way, Tractor met his best friend Gerald. Gerald was Tractor’s best friend because he didn’t make fun of Tractor’s name, at least not to his face and that’s basically the same thing! “Tractor my dude, whatcha been up to?” asked Gerald, to which Tractor recited everything that had happened to him today with a resounding “Not much, how about you?” This small-talk continued for a good thirty minutes or so as they brunched, before Gerald brought up the fact that today was the day that their planet was scheduled to be destroyed by a rival species. The two goofballs completely forgot!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oh well, might as well make the best of it! Want to head down to the park Gerald?” asked Tractor, most likely because he wanted to go down to the park. On their way to the park, however, something terrible and definetely expected to have at some point happened had happened. The ships had arrived and the bombs were dropping. “Well gosh darn it, here I was hoping to end my life off right, I even woke up on the right side of the bed and everything!” exclaimed Tractor, as he watched his friend Gerald get sucked into the air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Tractor, Tractor what is this thing? This swirling vortex is sweeping me off my feet high into the sky towards the ships above?” shouted Gerald increasingly loudly, as what he had to say was long and he had to try harder for Tractor to hear him as he was lifted into the sky towards his maybe demise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tractor beams, for he knew the answer.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>River's Salty Tales From the Crypt</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s finally here, the moment ten years in the making (roughly). River’s Salty Tales From the Crypt. A collection of tales that will inspire fear, heartache, love, and laughs (most likely).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RSTFTC isn’t actually finished yet, but it will be. And by that time, the universe will have descended into a state that will no longer allow for the processes to create entropy. In our lifetimes, however, you can expect a brand spankin’ new story EVERY MONTH UNTIL I DECIDE TO STOP AT SOME POINT AND SAY HEY THE BOOK IS FINISHED.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So without further ado, if you’d like to read the ramblings of an actual robot that isn’t very good at spelling, &lt;a href=&quot;http://rivergillis.com/posts/herb/&quot;&gt;you can be the first to own RSTFTC on VHS here!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
