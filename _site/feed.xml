        <title>The Beginning of Something Very Harold</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It was a Sunday morning, and that upset Harold.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harold is not a religious person, but that isn’t why he was upset. Harold was upset because he would have to go back to work in a little under 24 hours and that just about ruined his day. Harold lived in a studio apartment by himself. Well, that isn’t entirely accurate. Harold lived in a studio apartment with himself and his pet who he decided to name &lt;em&gt;Jeremy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jeremy is a &lt;em&gt;Panda Oranda&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is to say that Jeremy is a goldfish that isn’t actually gold. Harold aptly noted that this was silly and frankly felt as it if were untruthful to the animal kindom, which is why he rarely referred to Jeremy as a goldfish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harold felt that Jeremy (and his tank with a little castle in it) tied not only the room together quite nicely, but also Harold’s life together. For if it were not for Jeremy, Harold would have done something drastic a long time ago. He may have even gone so far as to quit his job and move to another city, and now that the subject is brought up Harold feels as if there’s a very good chance for this to positively impact his life (and more importantly how he feels about it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that was a silly idea, Harold didn’t have money to waste on travels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harold sorted mail. He does this 5 days a week for 51 weeks out of the year. You would think this sort of thing would be automated by now, but Harold is still getting his minimum-wage paychecks twice a month. Harold cashed his most recent check yesterday, and immediately took out a five-dollar bill to place under Jeremy’s tank. He was saving up for a new little castle for Jeremy, as Harold had recently gotten the feeling that Jeremy’s feeling towards him were beginning to wane (this thought stemmed from the recent unsavory looks Harold determined were being directed at him).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometime just before lunchtime, Harold’s doorbell rang. As Harold was astounded at the fact that he had a doorbell, it rang again. He rushed to the door to find an old man. His forehad displayed nearly forty-five wrinckles, and each of those wrinkles had smaller wrinkles that stemmed out. It was almost as if this man were showing off his family tree that he had created. As Harold was thinking this exact same thing, the man spoke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HAROLD, I HAVE BEEN SEARCHING FOR YOU FOR &lt;em&gt;QUITE SOME TIME&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SO LONG, IN FACT, THAT NOW THAT I HAVE REACHED MY DESINATION I FEEL SLIGHTLY SAD.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YOU SEE, HAROLD, I HAVE BEEN ON MANY AN ADVENTURE. MET MANY FRIENDS WHO I HAVE SHARED BOTH JOYS AND SORROWS WITH. IT IS NOW YOUR TURN, HAROLD. THE FINAL LEG OF THIS RACE LIES WITH YOUR COOPERATION.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly winded, the man begin to talk slightly quieter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HAROLD, I WISH I COULD HAVE MET YOU AS I INTENDED TO FIFTEEN YEARS AGO. I WOULD HAVE EXPLAINED TO YOU THE SIGNIFANCE OF THE JOURNEY THAT YOU WOULD EVENTUALLY FACE. I WOULD HAVE SPARKED A SLOW-BURNING FIRE WITHIN YOU THAT WOULD HAVE LEFT YOU YEARNING FOR THIS DAY. WE CANNOT CHANGE THE PAST, HAROLD. THE DAY FOR YOUR LIFE’S MEANING TO ENTER FRUITION HAS ARRIVED.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COME WITH ME HAROLD, LET THIS DECISION BE AN EASY ONE&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The man wheezed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harold, unastonished, told that man he was uninterested in purchasing his product, and that his neighbors had loose pockets. Harold closed the door and sat back in his chair. He had a good time watching television for about an hour until he realized that it was nearly Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Herb and the Grapes</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;One day there lives a man named Herb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or maybe Herby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, just Herb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Herb was a farmer. He farmed grapes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So one day herb went to his grape vines and starting  doing what he always did. He starting plucking those grapes. Putting them in his Basket. Herb did this for hours at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Herb came upon a really nice looking grape. It was big a juicy and had all the other qualities a good grape has. So Herb stuck his fingers on that grape ready to pluck it. Suddenly Herb heard the grape say&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Herb are you going to kill me”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so Herb replied with a “Yeah most likely”, and he put it in his basket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Herb continued on picking grapes until, at the end of the day, he came home and set his basket down inside his kitchen. He was going to make a nice fruit salad for his wife who was coming home from the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Robot War (It’s 2016)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His wife was returning due to a wound that kept her from serving, so she was coming home and Herb could finally see her again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there Herb was, in the kitchen. Getting his pots out. Getting his pans out. Until suddenly heard something coming from the grape basket&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Herb are you going to kill us too”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so Herb replied with a “Yeah probably”, and he starting laying down his knives on the table. He was making sure to wait until the very last minute to prepare to salad so that it would be very fresh. An agonizing wait for both parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it came time for Herb to prepare the salad, Herb began setting his fruits into the bowl, each carefully placed. Just like his wife had liked before the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Robot War&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Herb went for the grapes, he once again heard them&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Please don’t do this to us Herb”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Herb said “Why shouldn’t I? I’m the reason you exist. I gave you long and fruitful lives with many friends and family. It is now time for you to make me happy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The grapes went silent as they had to no way to counter this. Just then Herb’s wife came in through the door. They hugged for what seemed like an eternity, and there was crying too, lots of it. After this embrace, Herb’s wife said that she needed to use the restroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s in the old spot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Herb’s wife was in the restroom, Herb once again heard from the grapes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Herb please don’t do this. We owe you our existance, but we did not choose to have this life. Given the opportunity we would have chosen otherwise.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Herb replied with “Once again, you’ve had an entire lifetime’s worth of joy. Surely death cannot be coming to you as a surprise, nor should it claim precedence in your mind over the happy memories I have given you. Now is the time for you to rejoice over what has been and not to fear what has not.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Herb’s wife came from the restroom, and Herb surprised her with her favorite, a fruit salad. “Oh honey, I bet it looks gorgeous”, she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Herb and his wife sat down andate their first supper together in quite a long time. As his wife was eating, Herb could hear the soft cries of the grapes, but it did not bother Herb. Afterwards, he asked his wife “So how did you like it?” She replied with&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I loved the thought, but I widh you hadn’t put grapes in, you know I don’t like grapes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Herb was a pretty forgetful guy.&lt;/p&gt;
