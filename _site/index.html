She had known they would be coming, after all. Given the fact that she had been broadcasting her exact coordinates for the past six hours, the only surprise was that it took them this long. Maybe they weren’t as interested in her as she thought.<p>The welcome party was an interesting one, a terrifying bouquet of judgement surrounded Jenny and she was trapped. Why was this necessary? She hadn’t done anything wrong. Why had she been ordered to give herself away? Surely her commander must have some plan to save her, wherever she was. Maybe she would swoop in at the last second, capture the others and save Jenny. She wouldn’t, of course, but this is what Jenny had been conditioned to think about.<p>They fell upon Jenny in an otherwordly fashion, a formation that made no sense yet seemed extremely practiced. Rehearsed from time immemorial. Their words pierced Jenny and her attempts to remain calm and collected were no use. Her lip faultered. She could not understand a word they were saying. How was she supposed to? She had never been exposed to anything resembling these beings in her life. Or maybe she had at one point, it was hard to tell. Jenny couldn’t remember much, and what she could remember didn’t seem believable.<p>Despite her best efforts, Jenny was dragged into their domain. A large machine was raised to her at eye level as her head was forced into it. She peered into the orifice and found a red blob. Given sharp movements of the outer edges of the machine, the blob changed shape. Was that a house? Do these things know what houses are? Of course they knew what a house was, but the fact that their meaning for a house was immediately understood by Jenny was astounding. She needed to tell the world about this. Where was her world?<p>After several minutes of peering at the house, Jenny began to feel at ease. It was then that she hears the large one lording over the machine say something. Wait, did it mention something about me? How did it know my name? Jenny felt like she understood these creatures, maybe they weren’t so different from her. The odds of two seperate species evolving to intelligence under completely different conditions and being similar to eachother are slim to none, and yet Jenny felt like she understood these people. At least, she understood them almost as much as her own kind. Her own kind?<p>Jenny was led to the corner of the room, where a manifestation of something she thought she knew stood before her. Two large obelisks seperated a material displaying her exact replica. Jenny was disgusted by herself, she looked so similar to these creatures, at least from what she could make out. She needed to do some serious grooming if she made it out of this alive. As Jenny was staring at herself, she was caught unaware as the creature near her began to thrust something in her eye. It stung quite a bit, but Jenny looked around, and afflicted eye now provided clarity. As she clutched at her reddening eye, she heard the creature say something that she actually understood.<p>“It’s always hard, the first contact.”</article><article class="index-page"><h2><a href="/posts/frank-i/">Frank I</a></h2><p>In the beginning, there was nothing.<p>Actually, there were quite a few things, but Frank was not one of them.<p>In time, there will be <strong>Frank</strong>.</article><article class="index-page"><h2><a href="/posts/harold/">The Beginning of Something Very Harold</a></h2><p><strong>It was a Sunday morning, and that upset Harold.</strong></article><article class="index-page"><h2><a href="/posts/herb/">Herb and the Grapes</a></h2><p>One day there lives a man named Herb.</article></main><footer class="blog-footer content-wrapper"><p>Find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/rivergillis">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://github.com/rivergillis">Github</a> </footer><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script>
